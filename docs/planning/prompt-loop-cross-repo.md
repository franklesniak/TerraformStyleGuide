We are working on:

- The `planning-CRT-PR-852` branch of [PSStyleGuide](https://github.com/franklesniak/PSStyleGuide). This branch is available locally at `C:\Users\flesniak\GitHub\PSStyleGuide`.
- The `planning-CRT-PR-852` branch of [TerraformStyleGuide](https://github.com/franklesniak/TerraformStyleGuide). This branch is available locally at `C:\Users\flesniak\GitHub\TerraformStyleGuide`.

I need to conduct the following loop:

- Against the `PSStyleGuide` repo, run a `/goal` pointed at the prompt in `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-01b-in-repo-with-criticism.md`. Wait for the goal to finish.
- Against the `PSStyleGuide` repo, run a `/goal` pointed at the prompt in `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-02-in-repo.md`. Wait for the goal to finish.
- Commit the changed files to `PSStyleGuide`.
- Copy the resulting `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\\\*PSStyleGuideP\*.md` files to the `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide` folder in the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo
- Commit the changed files to `TerraformStyleGuide`
- If new GitHub Issue file names have been introduced (e.g., there were four GitHub Issues previously drafted, but now there is six):
  - In the `PSStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - In the `PSStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - Commit the changes to the `PSStyleGuide` repo
  - In the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - In the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - Commit the changes to the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo
- Against the `PSStyleGuide` repo, run a `/goal` pointed at the prompt in `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-03-in-repo.md`. Wait for the goal to finish.
- Commit the changed file to `PSStyleGuide`.
- Copy `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\slate-criticism.md` from the `PSStyleGuide` repo to `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\slate-criticism.md` in the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo.
- Commit the changed file to `TerraformStyleGuide`.
- Against the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, run a `/goal` pointed at the prompt in `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-01b-in-repo-with-criticism.md`. Wait for the goal to finish.
- Against the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, run a `/goal` pointed at the prompt in `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-02-in-repo.md`. Wait for the goal to finish.
- Commit the changed files to `TerraformStyleGuide`.
- Copy the resulting `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\\\*TerraformStyleGuideP\*.md` files to the `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide` folder in the `PSStyleGuide` repo
- Commit the changed files to `PSStyleGuide`
- If new GitHub Issue file names have been introduced (e.g., there were four GitHub Issues previously drafted, but now there is six):
  - In the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - In the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - Commit the changes to the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo
  - In the `PSStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - In the `PSStyleGuide` repo, modify each `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\prompt-*-in-repo.md` file to reference the newly added/deleted/renamed files in the GitHub Issues slate, in the correct order.
  - Commit the changes to the `PSStyleGuide` repo
- Against the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo, run a `/goal` pointed at the prompt in `docs\planning\TerraformStyleGuide\prompt-03-in-repo.md`. Wait for the goal to finish.
- Commit the changed file to `TerraformStyleGuide`.
- Copy `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\slate-criticism.md` from the `TerraformStyleGuide` repo to `docs\planning\PSStyleGuide\slate-criticism.md` in the `PSStyleGuide` repo.
- Commit the changed file to `PSStyleGuide`.

Repeat the loop up to 12 times, or until the state of the GitHub Issue drafts across both repositories has converged/stabilized.
