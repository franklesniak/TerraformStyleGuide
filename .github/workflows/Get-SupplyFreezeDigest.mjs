// Derives the T1-SUPPLY-FREEZE-v1 digests reproducibly.
//
// Why this file exists. The original freeze record carried two fields recorded
// as "normalized SHA-256" -- one over `npm ls --all --json`, one over
// `npm audit --json`. The procedure that produced those two numbers was never
// committed; only its outputs were, in a pull request description. A digest
// whose derivation is unrecorded proves nothing, because a reader who computes
// a different value cannot tell whether the inputs changed or whether they
// normalized differently. Issue #22 requires "exact equality of every recorded
// field" against that record, which for those two fields no one could discharge.
//
// So the derivation lives here, in the repository, and the record quotes what
// this file produces. The two superseded values are NOT reproduced by this
// script and cannot be: their recipe is unknown. See docs/T1-SUPPLY-FREEZE-v1.md.
//
// This script is read-only. It runs no install, writes no file, and asserts the
// manifest and lockfile are byte-identical after it finishes.

// of those fixes was still answering "how is an http url spelled". It only ever
// matched two schemes, while formatUntrustedText is the general funnel for
// caller- and subprocess-controlled text. Measured, all five printed verbatim
// with both credentials intact:
//
//   ftp://user:SECRET@host/p?token=S2      file:///etc/x?token=SECRET

// between them and a retained log. Six rounds of widening a scheme allowlist
// that was never the right shape.
//

// Round 56, reported by Codex, and the round-55 fix caught in its own turn.
// That round moved this block above SUPPORTED_ARGUMENTS and then wrote that it
// "genuinely precedes every other statement". It did not: process.umask(), the
// three --flag membership scans and strWorkflowDirectory still ran ahead of it,
// so the claim was false in the same commit that made it. Fixing the position a
// reviewer pointed at and restating the invariant as though the class were
// closed is the habit this file keeps rediscovering.
//
// It is now the first executable statement in the module, ahead of every
// constant that is not a compile-time regular expression. That is checkable
// rather than asserted: nothing above this line executes except the four
// literal RE_ constructions, and the block depends only on hoisted function
// declarations and imports.
//
// The window between Node COMPILING this file and this read cannot be closed
// from inside the script -- the record says so, and no reordering changes it.
// What reordering buys is that the window is no longer widened by anything the
// caller supplies, which a long argument list previously did.
//
// The rationale below travelled with the code this time. Round 55 moved the
// statements and left rounds 12 and 13 explaining them from forty lines away,
// under a stub pointer -- the same split this loop has reported against the
// record four times.

// Round 12, reported. The self-read used to sit AFTER the toolchain guard, and
// therefore after an `npm --version` subprocess -- tens of milliseconds during
// which this file could be replaced. The process would go on executing the
// source Node had already loaded while reporting the SHA-256 of a different
// file, so restoring the reviewed bytes over a modified version inside that
// window produced the authoritative script digest for a run that derived every
// other field with other code. Neither the final content checks nor the
// quiescence sweep looked at the script.
//
// Three changes, because no one of them is sufficient. The read is now the
// first thing this script does, so the window between Node's load and the read
// contains no code of ours. The bytes are kept and re-compared at the end. And
// the script's own inode-change time is checked against PROCESS START rather
// than against the later recording ceiling, so a replacement anywhere in the
// process lifetime is caught.
//
// The residual, stated rather than implied: Node reads and compiles this file
// before any statement here executes, so a replacement in THAT window is
// invisible to the script itself and can only be closed by a trusted launcher
// hashing the file before invoking node. That is outside what one read-only
// script can bootstrap, and the record says so.
//
// Round 13, reported. `import.meta.url` is NOT always the file Node compiled.
// Under `--preserve-symlinks-main` -- which an ambient NODE_OPTIONS can supply --
// it is the symlink that was invoked, and measured, lstat on it reports
// isSymbolicLink() true while the source Node actually loaded is the target.
// Every check here would then have described the link's inode: its content
// comparison reads through the link and its ctime never moves, so a target
// modified at compile time and restored before the self-read would emit the
// reviewed digest for code that was never reviewed.
//
// Resolving first makes every subsequent check -- the digest, the content
// re-comparison and the ctime ceiling -- describe the bytes that were compiled.
// That alone closes the attack, because restoring a modified target during the
// run moves the TARGET's ctime past process start.
// Round 55, reported by Codex, and it is the round-12 comment being wrong about
// its own position. That comment says "the read is now the first thing this
// script does, so the window between Node's load and the read contains no code
// of ours" -- but argument membership and the unsupported-argument filter ran
// first, roughly 150 lines of code and one refusal ahead of it. A long argument
// list widens that window, and the ctime baseline was captured after it too, so
// a replacement landing inside it could be read as the reviewed bytes while the
// process kept executing the source Node had already compiled.
//
// The window between Node's compile and this read cannot be closed from inside
// the script -- the record says so -- but it can be kept as small as the
// language allows, which is what the comment claimed and did not deliver. The
// snapshot and its ctime baseline now genuinely precede every other statement.

// PATH shim: the shim was invoked by npm while the parent stayed on its own
// execPath, so `toolchain.node` described the parent alone.
//
// Binding by PATH rather than by exec'ing npm-cli.js directly, because npm is a
// symlink to a .js file here but a shell wrapper on other installs, and the
// wrapper case would silently keep the old behaviour. Putting this Node's own
// directory first makes `env node` resolve to it however npm is packaged.
//
// Round 60, reported by Codex twice over, and the round-31 reasoning above is
// what has to change rather than be extended.
//
// That comment chose PATH over exec'ing npm-cli.js "because npm is a symlink to
// a .js file here but a shell wrapper on other installs". True in general, and
// no longer relevant here: the installation is now pinned by digest, so the
// layout is not a guess -- bin/npm is known to resolve to a .js file inside
// lib/node_modules/npm, and that resolved path is what the fold authenticates.
//
// PATH resolution turned out to be attacker-influenceable in two separate ways:
//
//   a colon in the path. PATH is colon-SEPARATED, so prepending a directory
//   whose name contains ':' inserts two entries instead of one. A distribution
//   at /tmp/reviewed:copy/bin puts /tmp/reviewed first, and an attacker's
//   /tmp/reviewed/npm answers every call while the genuine
//   /tmp/reviewed:copy/bin/npm is the file both folds authenticate. A legal
//   POSIX path silently redirects the executable.
//
//   a different basename. npm's shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env node`, so the
//   prepend only binds the runtime if a file literally named `node` sits in
//   that directory. Invoke the reviewed binary as bin/node24 and `env node`
//   falls through to the ambient PATH, so the genuine npm CLI runs under an
//   attacker's runtime -- and both folds still pass, because the launcher and
//   the installation really are genuine.
//
// Both disappear if nothing is resolved by name. The child is now this
// process's OWN executable, running the resolved npm CLI by absolute path:
// no PATH lookup for the program, and no shebang to interpret, so the runtime
// is the same authenticated binary that is executing this line.
//
// The prepend is kept for npm's own internal lookups, and skipped when the
// directory contains a colon -- there it corrupts PATH rather than extending
// it, and with the direct invocation above it is no longer load-bearing.

// The installed tree, folded from the bytes actually on disk.

// because that is what the original record's field was named after. Attacking
// it before shipping showed the field would have been close to worthless:
// editing `node_modules/glob/package.json` to version 9.9.9 and re-running left
// the digest completely unchanged, because `npm ls` reports the resolved graph
// that the LOCKFILE determines, not the bytes present on disk. The lockfile's
// own SHA-256 is already a recorded field, so that digest restated an existing
// one while appearing to measure something new.
//
// This measures the stated intent instead -- what is actually installed, which
// is what actually runs. It is the same shape as the parser-tree fold the
// workflow policy already performs over node_modules/yaml, widened to the whole
// tree. Path and length are folded in alongside content so that renaming or
// truncating a file moves the digest, and symlink targets are folded in so a
// redirected `.bin` entry does too.
//
// Reproducibility is measured, not assumed: four independent `npm ci` installs
// in four different absolute paths produce identical digests, which also proves
// no machine-specific path leaks into the hashed bytes.
//
// Round 28, reported. This said "three" while the pull request said "four", and
// the reported fix was to write "multiple" so the two could not disagree. The
// count IS the evidence here, so the disagreement was settled by re-running the
// experiment rather than by deleting the number: four installs, in four paths of
// deliberately differing lengths, all folding to one value. Recorded as four
// because four were run and observed, not because the larger number was chosen.
//
// Round 49, reported by Codex. That sentence used to name the value, and the
// value went stale the moment directory read bits were folded in one round
// earlier -- leaving a reader two different expected results for one recipe, in
// a file whose whole argument is that a hand-copied digest rots while looking
// authoritative. The count is kept because the count is what this paragraph is
// evidence for; the digest is dropped rather than restated because THE CLAIM
// HERE IS AGREEMENT, not the particular number they agreed on. Four installs in
// four paths folding identically is what proves no path leaks into the hashed
// bytes, and that survives any change to the fold. The current value has exactly
// one home, and it is the record.
//
// Re-running the four installs under the new fold would have let the number stay,
// and it is not restated from a single run instead: this host has no registry
// access, so four independent `npm ci` installs cannot be performed here, and a
// number copied from one run would assert an agreement nobody measured.
//
// Every variable-length field is length-prefixed, and that is load-bearing
// rather than tidiness. Reported and confirmed: the first framing wrote
// `L <path> -> <target>\n`, which is not injective, because a POSIX path or
// symlink target may itself contain a newline. Two genuinely different trees
// hashed identically --
//
//   tree one:  a -> "T\nL b -> U",  c -> "V"
//   tree two:  a -> "T",            b -> "U\nL c -> V"
//
// both feed `L a -> T\nL b -> U\nL c -> V\n`. Measured, not argued: the two
// directories produced the same digest.
//
// The same defect was in the FILE framing and was not reported; carrying the
// finding across found it. `F <path>:<length>\n<content>` collides just as
// readily -- one file named `a:2\nXYF b` containing `ZW` hashes exactly like two
// files `a` and `b` containing `XY` and `ZW`. Also measured.
//
// Length-prefixing makes the encoding prefix-free: a reader takes the tag, then
// digits up to the separator, then exactly that many bytes, with no ambiguity
// about where a field ends. Directories are recorded too, so a stray empty one
// cannot hide in a tree whose files are all accounted for.

//
// Codex offered "include or refuse". These REFUSE rather than fold, and the

// the published bytes, so hashing them would make the tree digest differ between

// entries in one directory therefore share a decoded name whenever one has an
// undecodable name and the other is literally named U+FFFD -- and `join` then
// resolves BOTH loop iterations to the second file.
//
// Measured, with a directory holding one entry named 0x80 and one named
// 0xEF 0xBF 0xBD (U+FFFD's own encoding):
//
//   readdir decoded names   ["�", "�"]   -- equal

// So the 0x80 file's bytes were never read: the count said 2179 while one file
// was hashed twice and another not at all. The ctime sweep is blind for the same
// reason -- it decodes names the same way, so both entries collapse to one label
// and it lstats the same file twice -- which is why the run above completed and
// reported a tree it had not measured. A file whose content never reaches the
// digest is content an attacker may choose freely.
//

// proven it cannot measure. Folding raw bytes would let it RECORD such a tree,
// which is a capability this record does not need and would buy by threading
// Buffers through the symlink, special-file and label paths of the one function
// least safe to rewrite for a case npm does not produce.
//

        // Round 41 corrected the sentence that stood here. It claimed "a chain
        // that leaves the tree in two hops is caught", and that was false: it was
        // caught only if it ENDED outside. Codex refuted it, and the measurement
        // is below. Writing the claim down is what stopped it being checked.
        //
        // Round 39, reported by Codex. The previous version swallowed a failed
        // resolution on the claim that "the quiescence sweep refuses it as a
        // changed input". That claim was false, and the sentence writing it down
        // is what made it look answered: the sweep lstat()s tree entries, and
        // lstat reports the LINK's own inode, so a target that appears and
        // disappears outside the tree never moves anything the sweep reads.
        //
        // Measured, with node_modules/eastasianwidth/vendor-helper.js pointing at
        // an absent external path:
        //   record run  (target absent)  -> exit 0, digest aa1d1b71c280, 0 refusals
        //   build window (target present) -> the external file loads via require
        //   verify run  (target absent)  -> exit 0, digest aa1d1b71c280
        // `npm ls` reported the lockfile satisfied throughout, because the link
        // is nested rather than a top-level package. Both a recording run and a
        // verifying run agree at exit 0 while the code that actually loaded came
        // from outside the digest.
        //
        // So a failed resolution refuses. Not only ENOENT: when resolution fails
        // for ANY reason this fold cannot establish containment, and containment
        // is the entire claim this guard makes. Refusing an unproven claim is the
        // conservative reading, and it is the reading that does not have to be
        // revisited when a new errno shows up.
        // Round 41, reported by Codex. EVERY HOP is tested for containment, not
        // just the endpoint. realpathSync collapses the whole chain, so a link
        // that leaves the tree and comes back read as contained:
        //
        //   node_modules/eastasianwidth/zchain.js -> /tmp/mid41 -> <in-tree file>
        //
        // Measured on this tree, repointing /tmp/mid41 between two runs while the
        // link's own text stayed `/tmp/mid41` throughout:
        //   /tmp/mid41 -> eastasianwidth.js  exit 0, 0 refusals, 7480241947adfc1c
        //   /tmp/mid41 -> README.md          exit 0, 0 refusals, 7480241947adfc1c
        //
        // Both endpoints are already folded, so both sets of bytes are inside the
        // digest. What is NOT inside it is WHICH of them `zchain.js` selects, and
        // that selector is an out-of-tree pointer anyone can repoint between the
        // recording run and the build that loads through it. Two runs emit the
        // same successful freeze record over different executing code -- the
        // exact failure the round-38 endpoint check exists to stop. An
        // intermediate hop simply walks around it.
        //
        // The rule enforced is: RESOLUTION NEVER LEAVES THE TREE. Every component
        // the walk passes through -- not merely the symlinks, not merely the
        // endpoint -- must be inside the real root.
        //
        // Round 42 replaced a narrower rule with that one, reported by Codex.
        // Round 41 required only that every symlink FOLLOWED live inside the
        // tree, which still admitted:
        //
        //   zg.js -> /tmp/control42/../../<abs path back into node_modules>
        //
        // Measured: the kernel resolves and reads it, and the guard accepted it
        // at exit 0 with zero refusals. /tmp/control42 is an ordinary directory,
        // so round 41 never tested it -- but its TYPE is not covered by the
        // digest either. Replacing it with a symlink to /tmp/evil after recording
        // sends the `..` somewhere else entirely, and the link text, and so the
        // digest, never move. An out-of-tree component is uncovered whatever it
        // happens to be today.
        //
        // A useful consequence: an absolute target now fails at its first
        // component, because an absolute path starts at "/" and works inward.
        // That refuses absolute links without a separate rule for them, and it
        // closes the reproducibility gap round 41 recorded but did not fix --
        // an absolute target folds a machine-specific string.
        //
        // That is the precise invariant, and it took two wrong versions. The
        // fold pins a link by hashing its target TEXT, so the mapping from that
        // text to bytes has to be decided entirely by things the digest covers --
        // that is, by entries inside the tree. Any symlink OUTSIDE the tree that
        // the resolution passes through is a pointer the record does not cover
        // and an attacker can repoint afterwards.
        //
        // The first attempt walked hop by hop and called realpathSync() on each
        // hop's parent before testing it. That silently resolved the outside hop
        // instead of catching it, and it accepted:
        //
        //   zparent.js -> /tmp/outdir41/back/README.md   (/tmp/outdir41/back
        //                                                 being a symlink back
        //                                                 into node_modules)
        //
        // which is the same defect one directory level up: repointing
        // /tmp/outdir41/back changes which in-tree file loads. The comment there
        // asserted that case was covered. It was not, and only running it said
        // so -- the assertion is what stopped it being checked, exactly as with
        // the two-hop sentence this round corrected.

      // out of the DIGEST deliberately: they do not affect loadability.
      //
      // They are no longer outside the RECORD, and the reason is the POSIX ACL
      // finding. An ACL granting write to a named user widens the ACL mask, and
      // per acl(5) the mask IS what st_mode's group bits report -- so
      // `setfacl -m u:someone:rw-` on a 0644 file reads back 0664 with the bytes

      // "harmless machine state" when it is the signature of a frozen tree

  // target the kernel stored as `d/\x80` therefore came back as `d/�`, and
  // re-encoding that for the next `lstat` asks for a DIFFERENT file -- one
  // literally named with the three bytes `EF BF BD`. An actor who plants that
  // sibling gets the sweep to watch the decoy while npm follows the link to the
  // real target, which can then be rewritten mid-run and restored invisibly.
  //
  // Measured, with the link pointing at `d/<0x80>` and a decoy at `d/<EF BF BD>`:

  //
  // Sweeping the directory's own ctime closes the create-and-remove case that a
  // content comparison structurally cannot: a file that is gone by the end has no
  // content to compare, but creating an entry and removing it both move the
  // ctime of the directory that held it. Measured, create-then-delete of .npmrc
  // moved this directory's ctime by 164 microseconds -- absent before, absent
  // after, and the mutation still visible.
  //
  // The directory is swept rather than the .npmrc path specifically, because the
  // defect is not about one filename: anything appearing beside the manifests
  // mid-run is a write into the directory whose contents this record describes.
  //
  // Round 57, reported by Codex, and the round-56 fix directly above caught one
  // case short. A directory's ctime moves when an ENTRY is created or removed --
  // it does not move when an existing file's CONTENTS are rewritten, because
  // that changes the file's inode and not the directory's. Measured on a
  // pre-existing .npmrc, rewritten hostile and restored benign:
  //
  //   directory ctime moved: false   <- all the round-56 sweep watched
  //   file      ctime moved: true    <- what nothing watched
  //
  // So a committed or pre-existing .npmrc could be rewritten after the transport
  // check, consumed by the audit, and restored, with the directory sweep seeing
  // nothing. npm documents the per-project .npmrc as a configuration source
  // distinct from the user and global files the audit call redirects, so this is
  // a live source rather than a theoretical one.
  //
  // The file is therefore swept in its own right, as an OPTIONAL path: it does
  // not exist in this repository today, and a check that refused every run for
  // the absence of a file nobody ships would be worse than the hole it closed.
  // Both halves are needed and neither subsumes the other -- the directory
  // catches create-and-remove, the file catches rewrite-in-place.

// The advisory posture, reduced to what a policy decision actually turns on.
//
// Kept: which package is affected, its resolved severity, whether it is direct,
// and per advisory the stable GitHub Security Advisory identifier, its severity,
// CWE list, CVSS score and vector, and affected range.
//
// Dropped, deliberately:
//   * `title` -- prose. GitHub rewords advisory titles without the advisory
//     changing identity, so a title in the digest produces drift that means
//     nothing. The GHSA id is the identity.
//   * `fixAvailable` -- changes the day a fix ships upstream. That is news, but
//     it is not a change in what this repository installs.
//   * `effects` and `nodes` -- derivable from the tree fold above, so including
//     them would make one change move two numbers.
//
// Unlike the tree fold, this digest is NOT reproducible from the lockfile alone
// and is not meant to be: it is a snapshot of an advisory database that changes
// as new advisories are published.
//
// Round 11 correction. This comment used to say drift here "calls for a policy
// re-decision, not a failed build", which reads as non-blocking and contradicts
// the record: the advisory fields ARE compared, so a mismatch IS an equality
// failure. What differs is the response -- re-decide the policy rather than
// investigate the tree -- not whether the check fails. The record was corrected
// one round earlier and this comment was left behind, which is the same partial
// fix the correction was about.
// Round 56, reported by Codex. JSON.parse builds objects by repeatedly defining
// properties, so when one object carries the same key twice the LAST value
// silently wins and the earlier one is gone before any shape check can run.
// Measured on a two-record `vulnerabilities` object naming one package twice:
//
//   {"pkg":{severity:"high", via:["GHSA-real-real-real"]},
//    "pkg":{severity:"low",  via:["GHSA-fake-fake-fake"]}}
//   -> Object.keys(...).length === 1, and the HIGH record is the one discarded
//
// Every downstream check then sees a complete, well-formed, one-record report:
// the package count is consistent, the shape validates, and auditSha256 folds
// only the survivor -- so altering the discarded record does not move the
// digest. An endpoint can hide an advisory behind a duplicate of its own
// package name and this script exits 0 with a clean posture.
//
// The TEXT is scanned rather than the parsed value, because by the time there
// is a parsed value the evidence has been destroyed. Only text JSON.parse has
// already accepted is scanned, so this is looking for a repeat rather than
// validating grammar. A string is a KEY when the next non-whitespace character
// after it is a colon, which in well-formed JSON happens only inside an object;
// array scopes push a null so that strings inside them are never counted.
//
// Keys are compared DECODED, not as raw source. "a" and "a" are the same
// member name and a raw comparison would call them different -- the escape is
// exactly what an endpoint hiding a duplicate would reach for.

// comment above used to DEFEND the statSync choice: "the two agree about what is

// dismissed the residual as "a hostile npm written into the reviewed Node's own
// bin directory -- requires write access to the toolchain itself", and that

//
// process.version is genuinely v24.18.1 because it IS the reviewed binary, so
// the toolchain guard is satisfied honestly; existsSync passes because the
// attacker put a file there; and all seven real advisories are erased from a
// record that says, in its own output, that it is a freeze record.
//
// So npm is authenticated by its bytes. `dirname(execPath)/npm` in a Node
// distribution is a symlink into `lib/node_modules/npm`, and that whole
// installation is folded and compared against the digest of the npm shipped
// inside the reviewed Node archive. Two conditions, and neither alone is
// sufficient:
//
//   containment -- realpath(the npm that will run) must land INSIDE the folded
//                  tree. Folding a genuine tree while a different file executes
//                  as npm is exactly the gap this finding is about, one level in.
//   bytes       -- the folded tree must equal REVIEWED_NPM_TREE_SHA256, so a
//                  replicated directory layout is not enough; the attacker has
//                  to supply the real npm, at which point it is the real npm.
//
// REVIEWED_NPM_TREE_SHA256 was NOT taken from the container this was developed
// on. It is derived from node-v24.18.1-linux-x64.tar.xz downloaded from
// nodejs.org, whose SHA-256 was checked against the digest markdownlint.yml and
// build.yml already pin before the archive was opened -- so the constant comes
// from the same bytes CI extracts, not from a local directory of unknown
// provenance. Both fold to f5855634..., 1916 files and no symlinks.
//
// The byte comparison is gated on --any-toolchain and the containment check is
// not, which is the same line the version guard draws: that flag waives which
// VERSION is acceptable -- and a digest over a tree IS a version -- while never
// waiving whether the program answering is the one this process resolved.
//
// The residual, stated rather than implied, because the round-55 reply's
// residual was wrong and this one should not be taken on trust: the tree is
// folded at one instant and npm executes a moment later, so a replacement

//
// A key belongs here when its value can carry a host, a username, a token or a

// which is why this is a property consulted by the formatter rather than a flag
// passed at one call site. REVIEWED_NPM_CONFIG's keys are booleans, small

// Round 48, reported by Codex. `noproxy` was missing, and it is the one key in

//
//   NPM_CONFIG_NOPROXY=private-user.internal,SUPPLYSECRET.example

// not a judgement that noproxy is safe, it was the test not being run over the

// boolean and needs no cover; `noproxy` was the gap.

// enumerations and an integer umask", which is true of that table and was doing
// duty as if it described both. configDrift formats BOTH tables -- the transport

// Round 44, reported by Codex against the record's package names. Sweeping the
// class rather than the site: this is the ONE funnel every piece of untrusted
// text passes through on its way to an operator, and it redacted urls while

// output, the endpoint's own `message`, and normalizeAudit's TypeErrors, which
// embed report package names and field values.
//
// Renamed from redactUrlsInText because it now does both jobs and the name has to
// say so; a caller reaching for "redact" would not have guessed it also escapes.
//
// Escaping happens HERE, at the print site, and deliberately not where these
// names are hashed. formatTreeName is not injective -- a name holding the literal
// four characters \x0a and a name holding a real newline escape to the same
// string -- so escaping before the digest would create exactly the collision
// class rounds 43 and 44 have been closing. The JSON record keeps the raw bytes,
// where JSON.stringify escapes them losslessly.
//
// Round 46, reported by Codex, in the redaction added one round earlier for the
// unrecognized-argument defect. The prefilter matched lowercase http/https only,
// so the case of the scheme decided whether a credential was withheld. Measured
// on the same secret, twice:
//
//   --registry=https://registry.example.invalid/path?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> https://registry.example.invalid/ (path, credentials and query redacted)
//   --registry=HTTPS://registry.example.invalid/path?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> printed verbatim, token included
//
// The referee, again, is a specification rather than my judgement: RFC 3986
// section 3.1 says scheme names are case-insensitive, and the WHATWG URL parser
// lowercases the scheme, so `new URL('HTTPS://h/')` has protocol 'https:'. This
// prefilter feeds that parser and disagreed with it about what a URL is -- the
// same shape as round 45's escaper disagreeing with ECMA-262 about what ends a
// line. A prefilter is allowed to be broader than its parser; it must never be
// narrower.
//
// Round 48, reported by Codex, and it is the sentence directly above being
// violated by the same expression two rounds later. The class excluded the two
// quote characters, so a quote inside a URL ENDED the match and everything after
// it was printed untouched. Measured on the unrecognized-argument refusal:
//
//   --registry=https://host/a'b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> https://host/ (path, credentials and query redacted)'b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//   --registry=https://host/a"b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> https://host/ (path, credentials and query redacted)"b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//   --registry=https://host/ab?token=SUPPLYSECRET        (the control)
//     -> https://host/ (path, credentials and query redacted)
//
// That output is worse than no redaction: it carries the parenthetical that says
// the query was withheld and then prints the query. `'` is a sub-delim under RFC
// 3986 section 2.2 and legal in a path; `"` is not, but the WHATWG parser accepts
// it and percent-encodes it, and `new URL()` -- the parser this prefilter feeds
// -- takes both. So both were narrower than the parser, which is the one thing
// the rule above forbids.
//
// The class was made whitespace-delimited: a run of non-space characters after
// the scheme, on the reasoning that trailing punctuation gets swallowed into the
// redaction rather than left outside it, and that redactUrl fails CLOSED on
// anything it cannot parse. That comment then claimed "there is no character this
// can now stop at except whitespace, so there is no third quote-like character
// waiting to be found in round 49."
//
// Round 49, reported by Codex, and that sentence was wrong in the round it named.
// Whitespace IS a character the parser accepts inside a URL: the WHATWG parser
// percent-encodes an internal space rather than ending the URL there. Measured
// through the same refusal:
//
//   new URL('https://host/a b?token=SUPPLYSECRET')
//     -> https://host/a%20b?token=SUPPLYSECRET        (accepted)
//   --registry=https://host/a b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> https://host/ (path, credentials and query redacted) b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//
// The tab form behaves the same way. So the previous fix moved the boundary from
// two characters to one and left the shape of the defect exactly as it was.
//
// The real lesson is that NO delimiter works. A scanner has to decide where a URL
// ends, and the parser this scanner feeds accepts every character including
// whitespace -- so for any terminator chosen, a URL containing it is narrower than
// the parser, which is the one thing the rule above forbids. Enumerating
// terminators was never going to converge; that is why this is the third round on
// one expression.
//
// The only rule that is broader than the parser is to stop at nothing: from the
// scheme to the END OF THE LINE. A line terminator is the one thing that cannot
// sit inside a URL in this output, because the escaper below turns every line
// separator into a printable escape before anything is written.
//
// This also settles the case reported as "match the complete option value". Each
// argv element is formatted by its OWN call -- the callers map over arguments and
// join afterwards -- so for an argument, end-of-line and end-of-value are the same
// boundary, and the whole value is redacted without a separate code path.
//
// The cost is real and is accepted rather than hidden: text AFTER a url on the
// same line is withheld too, so npm's `request to <url> failed, reason: ECONNREFUSED`
// now reports the host and loses the reason. A withheld diagnostic is recoverable
// by rerunning; a published credential is not, and this output goes to CI logs.
//
// Round 50, reported by Codex, and it is the paragraph above being wrong about
// its own file. That paragraph defended end-of-line as the boundary by saying a
// line terminator "cannot sit inside a URL in this output, because the escaper
// below turns every line separator into a printable escape before anything is
// written". The escaper ran AFTER the scan, so at SCAN time a terminator was
// still a terminator -- a sentence true of the output, applied to the input.
// Measured on the unrecognized-argument refusal, separator between path and
// query:
//
//   --registry=https://host/a<LF>b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> https://host/ (path, credentials and query redacted)\x0ab?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//   --registry=https://host/a<U+2028>b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//     -> https://host/ (path, credentials and query redacted)\u{2028}b?token=SUPPLYSECRET
//
// CR and U+2029 behave as LF and U+2028 do. `new URL()` takes all four: it
// DELETES tab, LF and CR from its input and percent-encodes U+2028 and U+2029.
// So the prefilter was narrower than the parser it feeds for the third time --
// now on the one character class the round-49 rule was written around.
//
// The ORDER is inverted rather than the class widened again: escape first, then
// scan. After formatTreeName no line terminator exists anywhere in the string, so
// the class stops at nothing and round 49's sentence becomes true of the text
// being scanned rather than of text already printed. The class is kept rather
// than written `.`, which means exactly this under ECMA-262, because an
// expression that names its own boundary survives an edit that moves the escaper.
//
// Handing redactUrl already-escaped text is safe because that helper's output
// cannot carry what the escaper would have caught: for http and https the WHATWG
// host parser strips tab, LF, CR and the zero-width formats and REFUSES every
// other Cc/Cf/Zl/Zp code point, so protocol and host are printable ASCII, and the
// unparseable branch prints a length rather than a value. Probed over twelve such
// code points in three host positions -- every one either vanished or threw.
// Round 51, reported by Codex, and it is the round-50 fix directly above opening
// the hole it was written to close. Escaping FIRST rewrites tab, LF and CR into
// printable `\xNN`, which breaks the literal `https` the prefilter matches --
// while the parser DELETES those same three characters and parses happily.
// Measured on the unrecognized-argument refusal:
//
//   --registry=ht<LF>tps://host/a?token=ROUND51SECRET
//     new URL() -> https://host/a?token=ROUND51SECRET   (accepted)
//     printed   -> --registry=ht\x0atps://host/a?token=ROUND51SECRET
//
// CR and TAB behave the same, at every position inside the scheme. So the
// prefilter was narrower than its parser for the FOURTH round running, this time
// because the previous round's fix put an escaper in front of it.
//
// The referee is normative rather than mine. The WHATWG URL Standard's basic URL
// parser removes "all ASCII tab or newline" from its input and defines that set
// as exactly U+0009, U+000A and U+000D. Enumerating a set a specification CLOSES
// is not the guessing rounds 47-49 lost to -- it is reading the parser's own rule.
//
// The scan therefore runs on the RAW text and is broader than the parser on both
// axes the parser is permissive about: the scheme tolerates those three
// characters interleaved anywhere inside it, and the body is `[\s\S]*`, every
// character to end of string. That second half is what round 50 bought by
// escaping first, kept here without an escaper standing in front of the scan.
// The three characters are then removed before redactUrl, exactly as the parser
// removes them, so the span scanned and the string the parser sees are one URL.
//
// Escaping is applied LAST again -- to the untouched prefix, and to redactUrl's
// output as belt and braces. The latter is a no-op today, since that output is
// printable ASCII, but it means a future edit to redactUrl cannot forge a line.
//
// One redaction per call, because the body runs to end of string. That makes the
// withheld-line count exact, and it is now REPORTED rather than left silent:
// round 50 quietly widened the accepted cost from "text after a url on the same
// line" -- which the paragraph above still claimed -- to "every following line".
// Swept here rather than waiting to be told. Measured, an npm failure block lost
// all three of its `npm ERR!` lines with nothing in the output saying so.
// Swept in round 52, before a reviewer reached it, and it is the sentence three
// paragraphs up being wrong in the round that wrote it. That sentence claimed the
// scan is "broader than the parser on both axes the parser is permissive about".
// There is a THIRD axis. For a special scheme the parser does not require `//` at
// all: its special-authority-ignore-slashes state skips any run of U+002F and
// U+005C, including an empty run. Measured, all four accepted and all four
// leaking through a scan that demanded exactly two forward slashes:
//
//   https:host/a?token=...    -> https://host/a?token=...   (accepted, leaked)
//   https:/host/a?token=...   -> https://host/a?token=...   (accepted, leaked)
//   https:\\host/a?token=...  -> https://host/a?token=...   (accepted, leaked)
//   https:/\host/a?token=...  -> https://host/a?token=...   (accepted, leaked)
//
// So the separator is any run of either slash, or none, with the deleted
// characters interleaved -- the parser's own rule rather than a slash count I
// picked. Backslashes are NOT stripped before redactUrl the way tab, LF and CR
// are: the parser converts those itself, and removing them here would be this
// file editing a url rather than reading one.
//
// The cost of allowing an EMPTY run is real and accepted on the standing
// reasoning: prose containing a bare `https:` now has the rest of its line
// withheld, because nothing distinguishes that from a url this parser accepts.
// redactUrl fails closed on it and prints a length rather than the text. A
// withheld diagnostic is recoverable by rerunning; a published credential is not.
// The three expressions above are declared at the top of the module; see the

  // Round 20, reported. The inclusion flags did not bind the tree SELECTION:
  // `--package-lock-only` makes npm load the virtual tree from the lockfile
  // instead of the actual one on disk. Measured -- with no node_modules at all,
  // `npm ls --all --json --package-lock-only --include=...` exits 0 while the
  // same command with `--package-lock-only=false` exits 1.
  // Round 22, reported. `--all` does not survive an ambient `depth=0`: npm then
  // checks direct dependencies only and exits 0 with a transitive package
  // missing, recording treeSatisfiesLockfile true. Depth is pinned explicitly.
  // Round 24, reported and measured. Two more ambient escapes, and they escape
  // by different mechanisms, which is why one property was never going to catch
  // both. In a directory with an EMPTY but present node_modules, the pinned
  // command exited 1 as it should; with NPM_CONFIG_GLOBAL=true it exited 0 and
  // reported path=/opt/node22/lib -- the host's global tree, a different tree
  // entirely -- and with NPM_CONFIG_LINK=true it exited 0 having reported the
  // root and zero dependencies. Either would have recorded
  // treeSatisfiesLockfile: true for a tree containing nothing.
  // Round 59. `npm ls` uses a non-zero exit to mean "the tree has problems",
  // which is a fact about the tree and not a failure of the call -- the same
  // distinction `npm audit` needs, so it takes the same path. Previously the
  // throw escaped uncaught and a problematic tree ended the run at exit 1 with a
  // stack trace; now the output is classified by parseNpmJsonOrRefuse, which
  // refuses at the documented exit 7 when what came back is not a tree report.
  // Round 60, reported by Codex, and a regression I introduced one round
  // earlier. Round 59 moved this call to runNpmAllowingFailure so that a
  // problematic tree would stop crashing the run -- and that wrapper DISCARDS
  // the exit status. `npm ls` documents its non-zero exit as "extraneous,
  // missing, and invalid packages" and still prints a complete tree object,
  // so the checks below saw a report with the right root path and the right
  // top-level key set and passed it. Measured, against a manifest whose only
  // dependency is not installed:
  //
  //   exit status 1, stdout a valid tree object, .path present,
  //   top-level keys unchanged, the missing entry present with missing: true
  //
  // treeSatisfiesLockfile: true, for a tree that does not satisfy the lockfile.
  // Fixing the crash by widening what counts as success turned a stack trace
  // into a wrong answer, which is exactly what the round-29 comment warned
  // against two functions up and what I did anyway.

    // --userconfig and --globalconfig DO exist, and being command line they
    // outrank every file. Pointed at an empty source and a missing one: both
    // read as empty, and npm refuses the same path twice with `double-loading
    // config`, so the two must differ. No temporary file is written for this --
    // this script writes none anywhere, and re-introducing a writer to hold two
    // empty files would cost more than it closes.
    //
    // The PROJECT npmrc is NOT closed by this and is not claimed to be. It is
    // read from the directory this child runs in, npm has no flag that relocates
    // that source, and `--proxy=` is inert per above. What covers it instead:
    // the transport check above runs `npm config list --json` in the same
    // directory, and a committed .github/workflows/.npmrc is visible there --
    // measured, its proxy appears in that output -- so the static case exits 6.
    // Round 56/57 closed the window this comment used to leave open: the
    // quiescence sweep now covers the workflow directory AND .npmrc itself, so
    // a project npmrc created mid-run, or rewritten in place and restored, is
    // refused at exit 10. What remains is a project npmrc created in the window between that check
    // and this line, which is a write into the repository working directory

    //
    // Round 36, reported by Codex, and this is the round-35 fix above caught in

    // script runs: measured in this container, the process is uid 0 and
    // `mkdir /nonexistent` succeeds. Replacing one attacker-supplyable config
    // source with another one is not a fix.
    //
    // `/dev/null/...` cannot exist, and not by assumption. /dev/null is a
    // character device, so every path beneath it is ENOTDIR for everyone
    // including root -- measured, both `mkdir` and `touch` refuse. npm reads it
    // as an absent config file and the audit returns the true 7/7 posture.

// run could emit freezeRecord: true while its manifest and tree digests
// described bytes no longer on disk. Moved ahead of those checks, so the last
// thing to touch the filesystem before the sweep is this fold and the sweep
// still gets the final word on the inputs.
// Round 57, reported by Codex, and the round-56 npm authentication caught being
// a snapshot where it needed to be an interval.
//
// That round folded the npm installation once, before the first npm subprocess,
// and my reply called the remaining gap a TOCTOU the attacker "has to win a race"
// for. That undersold it by the width of the whole run. The fold happened around
// line 2450 and the last npm subprocess -- the audit -- runs roughly 950 lines
// later, so the window was not microseconds: it was every npm call in the
// program. With a writable copied distribution an actor could present the
// genuine tree to the check, replace bin/npm-cli.js immediately afterwards, and
// have the replacement answer the version, config, ls and audit calls. Nothing
// looked at the installation again -- not the tree folds, which walk
// node_modules, and not the quiescence sweep, which walks node_modules, the two
// manifests and the workflow directory.
//
// So the installation is folded a SECOND time, here, after every npm subprocess
// has run. Bytes rather than a stamp, because that is what the first fold
// compared and a replacement restored before this point must still be caught by
// the same measure. Refusing at exit 2 keeps this on the toolchain refusal, which
// is what it is: the program that answered was not the program that was checked.
//
// Round 71, reported by Codex, and this gate was wrong. It used to read: "gated
// the same way the first fold's byte comparison is -- --any-toolchain waives
// which npm is acceptable and marks the output not a freeze record, so there is
// no freeze record here to protect." Both halves of that were true and the
// conclusion did not follow.
//
// The first fold's COMPARISON is gated because it tests this installation
// against REVIEWED_NPM_TREE_SHA256, a constant a bypassed run has explicitly
// waived. This check tests nothing of the kind: it compares the run's OWN
// before value against its OWN after value, so it needs no reviewed digest and
// nothing about --any-toolchain makes it inapplicable. The fold itself
// (foldNpmInstallation, above) already runs unconditionally, so the baseline
// was being computed and then thrown away under bypass.
//
// What that cost: `npmTree` is emitted in the toolchain block of every run,
// bypassed ones included. Codex verified with a dummy npm CLI that writes into
// its own installation during `--version` -- the bypassed run exits 0 and
// reports the npmTree hash from BEFORE the write, so the record pairs one
// installation's hash with another installation's version, `ls` and audit
// answers. An explicitly-non-freeze record is still a record, and a value that
// describes a program that stopped existing mid-run is wrong rather than merely
// unblessed.
//
// This is round 66's finding AR again -- the npm ls exit 7 was bypassed by the
// same reasoning and corrected the same way -- so the rule is now explicit:
// --any-toolchain waives comparisons against REVIEWED_* constants, and nothing
// else. Self-consistency checks run in every mode.

// What this does and does not promise, stated plainly because the round-8
// comment on the fold above overreached and this is the correction -- and then
// this correction overreached in its turn, which round 29 had to fix. It read
// "between them the two mechanisms detect any write that lands before this sweep
// reads the affected entry". That was false in two distinct ways, and stating a
// guarantee this sweep does not provide is worse than the gap itself, because a

//
// First: it compared clocks that do not agree, measured at 2000 of 2000 writes
// missed inside a ~4 ms window. That one is now fixed -- see the comparison.
//
// Second, and NOT fixed because it cannot be by this means: any ctime comparison
// is blind below the filesystem's timestamp granularity. If an entry is written
// twice within one tick -- once before the baseline and once after the second
// fold -- both stamps truncate to the same value and the sweep sees no change.
// On ext3, one tick is a full second. The double fold is what actually covers
// that case, by comparing bytes rather than times; the sweep supplements it for
// writes that land after the second fold, and neither is a substitute for the
// other. Neither makes the walk atomic either: a write landing after the
// sweep has passed an entry is not detected by anything here, and cannot be,
// because a userspace sequential scan has no atomic snapshot to compare against.
// A filesystem-level snapshot would close it outright and is the right answer
// for a reader who has one; that is a property of the host, not of this script.

// Round 29, reported. This compared a filesystem-stamped ctime against a
// `Date.now()` ceiling -- two different clocks. Linux stamps inode times from
// the COARSE clock and truncates to the filesystem's granularity, while
// Date.now() reads the fine one, so a ctime is systematically backdated
// relative to the ceiling it was being tested against.
//
// Measured on this container, ext2/ext3, 2000 files each written strictly AFTER
// capturing the ceiling: 2000 of 2000 landed BELOW it, backdated by up to
// 4.13 ms. Not an exotic-filesystem edge case -- the comparison was wrong every
// single time within that window.
//
// The reported remedy of rounding the ceiling down by the granularity was
// measured and rejected: it breaks the documented workflow. This script is run
// as `npm ci && node Get-SupplyFreezeDigest.mjs`, so a backdated ceiling makes
// the install that just finished trip the refusal.
//
// So the comparison is now like-for-like. The baseline is a ctime read from the
// same filesystem, through the same lstat, truncated by the same granularity as
// every value it is compared against, captured before any recorded byte is read.
// No clock is consulted and no margin is guessed.
// Round 42, reported by Codex. Compared PER ENTRY. This used to compare one
// maximum against another, and a maximum silently loses any change that does not
// exceed it.
//
// If any swept inode carries a ctime AHEAD of the recorder's clock -- clock skew
// on a network filesystem, or a local inode stamped before the clock was stepped
// backward -- then the baseline maximum is that future value, and a write landing
// after the second fold gets a LOWER ctime. The maximum does not move, the
// comparison passes, and the run records a digest for bytes that are no longer on
// disk. Measured, with a control:
//
//   normal clock, mid-run write to a swept file  -> exit 10, refused
//   one inode stamped 600s ahead, same write     -> exit 0, ACCEPTED
//
// Same write, same timing; the only difference was one future-stamped inode.
//
// The per-entry comparison needs no clock at all -- it compares the baseline
// reading against the final reading of the same inode, so a ctime that moves in
// EITHER direction is a difference. That is where the skew-robustness comes from,
// and it is why a separate "refuse future ctimes" rule was considered and
// dropped: it would add a false-failure mode on a legitimately skewed network
// filesystem while detecting nothing this does not already catch.
// Round 68, found by sweeping my own previous round rather than reported. The
// compared value carries an inode AND a change time since the same-tick swap fix,
// and the optional-path sentinel -1 records absence, so ONE 'change time moved'
// label stood for four different transitions. Detection was correct for all four;
// the sentence the operator reads was wrong for three. Measured before this was
// added, driving the shipped functions verbatim:
//
//   inode differs, ctime identical -> "change time moved" above two IDENTICAL
//                                     timestamps
//   .npmrc appears mid-run         -> "change time moved" above "baseline
//                                     reading absent"
//   .npmrc removed mid-run         -> "change time moved" above "final reading
//                                     absent"
//   ctime moves, inode same        -> "change time moved"  (the one true case)
//
// The second is the worst of them: an appearing .npmrc is the project-config
// injection the optional sweep exists to catch, and something absent cannot have
// had its change time move. A refusal that contradicts its own data on its face
// is one an operator stops trusting, which costs more than the missing word.
//
// The round-57 note below is right that -1 makes all four transitions fall out of
// one equality test. That is a claim about DETECTION, and it was silent about
// reporting -- the label was then written as though a single transition existed.
//
// They are named apart because they are different attack signatures: a swap is
// not a rewrite and neither is an injection, and that distinction is what an
