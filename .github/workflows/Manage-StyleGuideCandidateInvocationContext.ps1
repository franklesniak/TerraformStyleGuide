#Requires -Version 5.1

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Creates and removes one journaled style-guide candidate invocation context.

.DESCRIPTION
Creates one unpredictable invocation root below an explicitly trusted
temporary parent and removes only exact, journaled ordinary entries. Cleanup
is nonrecursive and retains uncertain state.

.EXAMPLE
PS> . .\Manage-StyleGuideCandidateInvocationContext.ps1

Loads the context-management functions into the current scope.

.INPUTS
None. You can't pipe objects to this script.

.OUTPUTS
None. Dot-sourcing defines New-StyleGuideCandidateInvocationContext and
Remove-StyleGuideCandidateInvocationContext. The sibling archive helper is
loaded and bound as the candidate ownership authority; issuance checks and
source lifecycle procedures remain private.

    # The exact context objects this manager has issued. Membership is decided by
    # reference, so a structurally identical clone is not a member.
    #
    # Entries are never removed, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight.
    # Dropping a context on successful cleanup was tried first and is wrong: the
    # identity check runs during parameter validation, ahead of the already-disposed
    # branch, so a deregistered context would make a second Remove call throw
    # instead of returning cleanup-already-disposed with Success true. Idempotent
    # cleanup is a documented part of this contract and outranks the tidier set.
    #
    # The cost of keeping them is one object reference per context this process
    # creates, and a context is created once per invocation. It is proportional to
    # calls rather than to anything an input controls.
    #
    # The name is unqualified, like every other private in this file, because both
    # public functions are closures and are invoked from the script scope of
    # whatever dot-sourced them. A $script: reference resolves against THAT scope
    # at run time, so New- would have registered into the caller's scope and
    # Remove- would have looked in it and found nothing -- measured, 42 of 116
    # cases failed with a context still Active. The closure captures this reference
    # instead, and both functions mutate the one list.
    #
    # ReferenceEquals is written out rather than left to a comparer.
    # System.Collections.Generic.ReferenceEqualityComparer arrived in .NET 5 and is
    # absent from the .NET Framework 4.8 that Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs on, and
    # the default comparer decides equality by asking the objects -- which is the
    # question this register exists to stop asking.

    # the wrong question. A context is a mutable PSCustomObject held by its caller,

    # that decides what cleanup deletes stayed writable through it. Measured: after
    # New- returned, rewriting the four paths and the journal record paths on that
    # same object made cleanup delete a tree this manager never created, and report
    # cleanup-succeeded with Success true.
    #
    # These are the fields that may never legitimately change after issuance. The
    # journal's states, lengths, digests, count and next sequence all move during a
    # normal run and are governed by the schema checks instead.

    # That is exactly what made it forgeable. A caller holding a genuine Active
    # context could write 'Disposed' onto it and flip its Created records to
    # Deleted, producing a structurally valid terminal context -- and cleanup then
    # reported cleanup-already-disposed with Success true and zero filesystem calls
    # while the invocation directory was still on disk. Measured on both runtimes.
    #
    # That is worse than a missed refusal. A caller told the work succeeded does
    # not retry, so the directory leaks for the life of the machine.

        # ceiling applies -- 200000 empty files measured 19.11 MiB against 0.16 MiB
        # for a bounded read, and no ceiling is in force at that point because no
        # archive has been opened. MaximumEntry stops the enumerator once that many
        # paths have been seen; a caller expecting N passes N + 1, so "exactly N"
        # and "more than N" stay distinguishable. Because the enumerator ends on
        # its own whenever fewer than MaximumEntry paths exist, a returned count
        # below the bound is still the complete listing, which is what the presence
        # checks downstream rely on. Callers proving a path ABSENT must not pass a
        # bound: absence cannot be concluded from a partial listing.
        #
        # That rule is true and was, on its own, read too far: it does not follow
        # that an absence proof must read EVERYTHING. Every absence proof here names
        # the one path it is disproving, and asking the filesystem about that one
        # name is what MatchPath does. The whole-parent read it replaces was work an
        # unrelated party could inflate simply by keeping files in the same shared
        # temporary directory -- 50000 unrelated entries measured 660 ms and
        # 15.87 MiB on .NET 8, 389 ms and 19.96 MiB on .NET 10, against 72 ms and
        # 0.05 MiB filtered, and the creation loop below retries up to 16 times.
        #
        # Filtering must not become a weaker test, so it is a filter and nothing
        # more: the caller's exact full-path comparison is unchanged, and a search
        # pattern that matches extra names can therefore only be rejected by it. The
        # dangerous direction is matching too FEW, which a literal pattern cannot do
        # -- so a leaf carrying a wildcard metacharacter is refused rather than
        # pattern-matched. Existence APIs are not an option in its place: File.Exists
        # and Directory.Exists disagree with each other on a dangling symbolic link
        # (measured True and False on .NET 8 and .NET 10) and both report absent on
        # Windows, where the link is followed. Enumeration names entries without
        # following them, which is why it was chosen and why it stays.
        #
        # MaximumEntry uses an in-band sentinel: omitted means unbounded, and the
        # parameter defaults to zero, so the `-le 0` branch below is what serves the
        # absence proofs. That makes an explicit `-MaximumEntry 0` read as a bound
        # while meaning the opposite, which is how a cardinality check can be
        # neutered without looking neutered. Omission stays unbounded; an explicitly
        # supplied non-positive bound is a contradiction and is refused here, above
        # the try, so it is not reported as an enumeration failure and no filesystem
        # call is counted for a call that never happened. A bounded filtered read is
        # the same contradiction wearing the other hat -- it would reduce a named
        # absence proof to a partial listing again -- so the two are refused
        # together.
        # Exactly one of the two, always. There used to be a third shape -- neither,
        # meaning read everything -- and no call site has needed it since every read
        # became bounded or filtered. Keeping it meant an unbounded path existed for
        # a caller to reach, and reaching it did not require editing any call site:
        # parking the expected call under `if ($false)` so the source-order table
        # still counted it, then performing the live read through a variable holding
        # this same script block, left the suite green at 115 records and zero
        # failures with the whole parent materialized. Source cannot settle that,
        # because the indirection is unbounded in form; the mode is removed instead.
        #
        # The ceiling refuses the other half of the same trick. A bound is only a
        # bound if it is small: the largest legitimate one here is a journal-record
        # count plus one, which the closed schema caps far below this, so a value

        # WHAT THE REGISTER IS AND IS NOT. It raises the cost of a forgery. It is
        # not a boundary, and rounds 29 to 41 of this file's comments said it was.

        # Measured: a caller in this process reaches the register through
        # (Get-Command <public name>).ScriptBlock.Module.SessionState.PSVariable
        # and writes it, then gets cleanup-already-disposed with Success true over
        # an intact root. Removing the dot-sourced variable names closes the
        # cheapest route and nothing more; putting the state in New-Module session
        # state or in a nested closure was measured and reaches the same way. There
        # is no arrangement of PowerShell scope that hides state from code running
        # in the same process.
        #
        # That is not a gap this file can close, and it is not one that matters as
        # much as it first appears: the actor who can do it can call
        # [System.IO.Directory]::Delete directly without involving these scripts at
        # all. The register still earns its place -- it defeats every structural
        # clone and every replayed context, which is what the catalog exercises --
        # but the honest claim is cost, not impossibility.
        #
        # Reference identity is not forgeable by construction: the register holds
        # the exact objects this manager returned, compared by reference, so a copy
        # with identical contents is not a member however faithfully it was
        # reconstructed.
        #
        # This is checked LAST on purpose. Every forged context the suite already
        # exercises is structurally wrong in some specific way, and each of those
        # cases asserts the specific diagnostic it earns; putting identity first
        # would collapse all of them onto this one code and lose what they test.
        # A structurally perfect forgery is the only thing that reaches here.
        #
        # What this does NOT do is create a privilege boundary. Constructing that
        # forgery takes arbitrary code in this process, and that actor can call
        # [System.IO.Directory]::Delete without involving this script at all. The

    # FIFO created with mkfifo reports GetAttributes = Normal (128), carrying
    # neither Directory nor ReparsePoint, and the FileStream constructor then blocks

    # resolves. Windows needs no equivalent: named pipes live in the \\.\pipe\
    # namespace rather than the filesystem, so a journaled path under the invocation

        # it reads neither the mode nor the owner of this directory. Supply one that
        # no untrusted local user can write. A private invocation root is created
        # below it, which keeps other users out of that root's contents, but anyone
        # able to write this directory can rename the root away and put their own in
        # its place -- measured on Linux against a world-writable parent carrying no
        # sticky bit.
        #
        # .PARAMETER DiagnosticLabel
        # Specifies an optional opaque diagnostic label of at most 128 UTF-16 code
        # units. Omission stores the literal value unavailable.
        #
        # .EXAMPLE
        # $objContext = New-StyleGuideCandidateInvocationContext `

        # .SYNOPSIS
        # Reports whether this manager issued the supplied invocation context.
        #
        # .DESCRIPTION
        # Answers one question and changes nothing: was this exact object handed out
        # by New-StyleGuideCandidateInvocationContext in this process, and -- in the
        # default mode -- does the LIVE object still describe what it described then,
        # with a lifecycle state still matching the one this manager last set. When
        # ExpectedState or ExpectedValues is supplied, the CAPTURED value the caller
        # passed is authenticated in place of the corresponding live field, so a live
        # field mutated after capture is by design not consulted in that mode (see
        # those parameters and .OUTPUTS). Touches no filesystem entry, so a caller
        # can ask before it acts rather than discovering the answer after.
        #
        # This exists because a caller that deletes first and validates afterwards
        # has already deleted. That was the expansion helper's own shape until round
        # 32 moved candidate deletion into the context manager, where issuance is
        # proven: deleting on the strength of caller-supplied paths and proving
        # issuance only afterward was too late for the entries already removed. A
        # caller that must still act on a context before that authority runs has the
        # same need to ask first, and a supplied context's recorded lengths and
        # digests do not answer it: the context carries both the paths and the values
        # they are checked against, so the check proves it is self-consistent, not
        # that it is authentic.
        #
        # .PARAMETER Context
        # Specifies the raw TerraformStyleGuide.PrivateInvocationContext.v1 object to
        # test. Any value is accepted; anything unissued answers false.
        #
        # .PARAMETER ExpectedState
        # Specifies the lifecycle state the caller has already captured and intends
        # to act on. When supplied, this is the value authenticated against the
        # manager's own record instead of the object's current property. A caller
        # that omits it and then re-reads the property to branch has authenticated
        # one read and acted on another.
        #
        # .PARAMETER ExpectedValues
        # Specifies the captured context values the caller intends to use after
        # this check. When supplied, the manager authenticates that exact set
        # against its issuance snapshot rather than rereading the live context.
        #
        # .EXAMPLE
        # if (-not (Test-StyleGuideCandidateInvocationContextIssued `

        #     # Refuse before touching the filesystem.

        # .INPUTS
        # None. You can't pipe objects to this function.
        #
        # .OUTPUTS
        # [bool] In the default mode (neither ExpectedState nor ExpectedValues
        # supplied), true when this manager issued the context and the LIVE object
        # still describes what it described at issuance, and false in every other
        # case. When ExpectedState or ExpectedValues is supplied, the CAPTURED value
        # the caller passed -- not the live field -- is what is authenticated against
