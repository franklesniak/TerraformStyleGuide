# Repository instructions for TerraformStyleGuide

This repository uses two different documentation targets:

- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` contains actionable, normative rules and examples intended
  for LLM-based coding agents and for direct operational guidance.
- `STYLE_GUIDE_RATIONALE.md` contains explanatory content, rationale,
  additional context, design discussion, and human-oriented background material.
  It is an internal development file, not a consumer-facing artifact.

When making changes:

1. Put normative rules, requirements, prohibitions, and concise
   compliant/non-compliant examples in `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
2. Put extended explanation, reasoning, historical context, tradeoff discussion,
   and other human-oriented explanatory material in
   `STYLE_GUIDE_RATIONALE.md`.
3. Do not place extended rationale in `STYLE_GUIDE.md` unless it is necessary
   to understand or apply the rule.
4. If a change introduces or modifies a rule in `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, add or update
   corresponding rationale in `STYLE_GUIDE_RATIONALE.md` when useful.
5. Keep `STYLE_GUIDE.md` concise, scannable, and optimized for
   instruction-following by coding agents.
6. Consumer-facing style guide files (`STYLE_GUIDE.md` and its generated
   derivatives: `copilot-instructions.md`, `terraform.instructions.md`,
   `STYLE_GUIDE_CHAT.md`, `STYLE_GUIDE_FULL.md`) must not cross-reference
   other files in this repository, including each other.
7. `STYLE_GUIDE_RATIONALE.md` may cross-reference `STYLE_GUIDE.md` to help
   human contributors navigate between rationale and the corresponding rule.
   The CI build script strips these cross-references when generating
   consumer-facing artifacts.
